Copy and paste this table into your performance page where you want the accordion:

| What is Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)? | ![LCP Example](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1460925895917-afdab827c52f?w=800&q=80)<br><br>LCP measures how long it takes for the largest content element to become visible in the viewport. Good LCP is under 2.5 seconds. It's one of the Core Web Vitals metrics that Google uses for ranking. |
| What causes Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)? | ![Layout Shift](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71?w=800&q=80)<br><br>CLS happens when page elements move unexpectedly during loading. Common causes include images without dimensions, web fonts causing text reflow, and dynamically injected content. A good CLS score is under 0.1. |
| How can I improve Interaction to Next Paint (INP)? | ![Performance](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551650975-87deedd944c3?w=800&q=80)<br><br>INP measures responsiveness to user interactions. To improve it, break up long tasks, use web workers for heavy computation, debounce expensive operations, and avoid blocking the main thread with synchronous JavaScript. |
| Why does my page load slowly? | ![Loading](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504868584819-f8e8b4b6d7e3?w=800&q=80)<br><br>Slow page loads can be caused by render-blocking resources, large unoptimized images, too many HTTP requests, lack of caching, or heavy JavaScript execution. Use browser DevTools to identify bottlenecks. |
| What are the Core Web Vitals? | ![Analytics](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71?w=800&q=80)<br><br>Core Web Vitals are three key metrics Google uses to measure user experience: LCP (loading performance), FID/INP (interactivity), and CLS (visual stability). These metrics directly impact your search rankings. |
